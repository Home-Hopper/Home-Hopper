# What's Home Hopper?

Home Hopper is a React application that simulates a real site where you can publish advertisements for rooms you rent, it's based around the idea of mainly short term arrangements with landlords. 

You can register either as a regular user or a landlord and start advertising, both type of users have the possibility to save rooms they like in their favorites and contact the room's owner via phone. The application is also fully responsive so it can be viewed from (almost) any device :)

Here's a little preview of the application, there's also a link to it under if you want to try it out yourself!
